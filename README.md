# Global Income Inequality

## Overview
Income inequality is a consideration for both social justice and economic reasons. This web app is designed to provide a quick overview of global income inequality. It provides a global overview of income inequality, looks at changes over time, and allows users to select a country to view detailed data.

The app can be viewed [here](https://world-income-inequality.herokuapp.com/).
